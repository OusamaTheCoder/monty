# Monty Project - C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

## Overview
The Monty Project involves implementing operations related to stacks and queues using C. The project is a part of the CGroup project on algorithms and data structures. It is to be done in teams of two people, and the team members for this project are Ousama Oujaber and Fatima El Asri.

## Project Details
- **Weight:** 2

- **Checker Release:** Dec 12, 2023, 10:00 PM
- **Auto Review:** Will be launched at the deadline

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you are expected to understand:
- What LIFO and FIFO mean
- What a stack is and when to use it
- What a queue is and when to use it
- Common implementations of stacks and queues
- Most common use cases of stacks and queues
- The proper way to use global variables

## Resources
